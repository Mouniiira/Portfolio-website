A y2k-computer inspired interface to showcase my work.

## ✦ Features
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## ☁︎ The process
**Research & inspiration** 
I was inspired by the Y2K Windows interface because I love the aesthetics of that time. I researched tools that would've helped me achieve my vision.

**Planning & design**  
I outlined the main features, created simple sketches or wireframes, and chose an appropriate tech stack. I also think about data flow and structure before coding.

**Development**  
I built the project step by step, making sure the features in my code were functional. I tracked my  progress on here and tested features as I implement them.
